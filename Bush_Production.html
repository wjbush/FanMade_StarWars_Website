            <p>Darth Zallak also known as the "Unknown Nightmare" by his enemies, was a Sith who doubted the rule of 2 heavily! Saying "An apprentice slows you down at the beginning & will betray you in the end. Why have an apprentice, when you can have servants?" He brought great fear to the galaxy by killing jedi, propelling species to be extinct or near the brink of extinction & destroying fleets with the super weapon he pioneered called the <a href="Ruination.html">"Ruination"</a>. Leading army of <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss">Chiss</a> and <a href="https://www.fandom.com/articles/star-wars-history-of-mandalore-mandalorian">Mandalorians</a> until the Jedi <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tarre_Vizsla">Tarre Vizla</a> left the Jedi Council to lead Mandalore the correct way to bring prosperity back to the galaxy. This caused a war between the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss">Chiss</a> led by Darth Zallak & Mando'ade led by <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tarre_Vizsla">Tarre Vizla</a> which ultimately led to <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss">Chiss</a> betraying Darth Zallak and him being imprisoned but escaped once he believed the time was right & went into construction of a Sith holocron. He in the long time returned to the core regions of the galaxy to fight the Republic and Jedi single handedly, which led to the death of the multiple jedi, thousands to millions of civilians & republic troopers. While many think his attack was a pointless attempt and/or final stand to seize control of the galaxy, he did it to show how weak Jedi and Republic were which led to people losing faith in the Republic and Jedi, & fearing the next return of the Sith. </p>

He worked his way through the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss_Ascendancy/Legends">Chiss Ascendancy</a> hiding his force powers from everyone, but thanks to his father who taught him hard work and discipline he was able to hide his force abilities. <a href="Dliz.html">Dliz</a> would have his son hunt & kill dangerous creatures from other worlds in order to build his son’s strength. Merro was top of classes and was the best pilot, general & warrior the <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chiss">Chiss</a> had at the age of 16. He continued to perfect his natural including his supernatural abilities by his father who wanted his son to lead a massive army with his unnatural powers because <a href="Dliz.html">Dliz</a> believed the Jedi were to weak & spend their resources to win wars not “keep the peace”.
