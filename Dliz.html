        <p>The quote above is one of the many personal shots Dliz took on the Jedi Council. Dliz was an excellent Republic war general. His tactics and schemes had very few flaws and left not only apposing generals in fear but his fellow comrades in fear. When he first joined the Republic, he was looked down upon due to him not being human like over 80% of the cadets. This made him the man he'd ultimately become, because he had no friends and everyone hated him, he'd do nothing in his free time but study schematics and his opponentâ€™s strategies & tendencies so he would destroy them on the field of battle. Once he graduated top of his class and highest scores in the Republic's Academy history, he quickly moved up the ranks in never built a personal relationship with anyone until having a wife who gave birth to Merro. Dliz's wife would end up dying due to a pirate fleet invading a planet his wife and son were vacationing at but instead of Dliz blaming himself, he blamed the Jedi who had a station there but did not want to get to involved due to them wanting to avoid violence! Which was all the pirates were interested in. Merro lived on Dliz's capital ship in his headquarters, protecting/studying his father's war tactics and stories of the species on all the planets his father visited. Dliz would leave the Republic 3 years after the death of his wife due to him losing hope in the Republic & Jedi. He learned of his son's force abilities and began training him to be a warrior & general the galaxy has never seen. Dliz would die on the Sith home planet Korriban by his son, which was the point that Merro turned into Darth Zallak the "unknown nightmare".</p>
