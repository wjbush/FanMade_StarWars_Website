                <p>The Ruination was a super weapon controlled by Darth Zallak during his time of rule. It was a weapon that was built to disintegrate anything that got caught in the blast. It is most known for its use in the battle over Csilla. In this battle the Republic and Jedi sent a huge portion of their forces to deal with the Darth Zallak & his forces. Once their forces were caught in multiple conflicts around the planet, Darth Zallak brought the Ruination out of hyperspace. This caught the eye of Darth Zallak's & Republic's forces. Once fired six star cruisers, over 100 starfighters and seven Jedi were disintegrated in the blast. This left the Republic and Jedi in shambles. Their comms were hectic. Friends & family of the surviving soldiers were gone forever, soldiers and Jedi calling out to their fallen breathen hoping for a response and the commanding generals ordered an imediate retreat. But their was a second blast right before the Republic jumped into hyperspace which destroyed two star cruiser. To put this into perspective a minimum of 500 soldiers are stationed on a star cruiser and the max is 1000, this of course depends on the ship. This means the Ruination killed a 4,107 to 8,107 people in that one battle. The Ruination was used in many more battles including in the War between Mandalorians and the Chiss. This ship lasted 10 more years after the death of Darth Zallak, for only defense just in case the Republic or Jedi seeked revenge, but was dismantled when the Republic and Chiss Ascendancy made a peace treaty. </p>
